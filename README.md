## Research work	
### Changes in Post-Socialist Industrial Linkages: A Network Approach
Sole author  
We study the changes in input linkages in post-Socialist economies between 1990 and 2021. We    analyze the differences in the evolution of input shares between post-Socialist countries that joined the European Union (CEEU countries) and those that remained in the Russian sphere of influence and joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This is done by analyzing an Input-Output network based on the EORA database. From this chapter, we detect different patterns between both groups of countries. CEEU countries tend to partake more in international linkages, while CIS countries tend to be more selfreliant.

### Autocatalytic set and Eastern European Industrial Development
Sole author  
We use network modelling and the autocatalytic sets framework of Jain and Krishna (1998) to explain how cumulative causality processes influenced Post-Socialist Countries’ industrialization. We detect autocatalytic relationships between industries within the WION and measure their effects on price competitiveness. Finally, we analyze the industrialization of Central and Eastern Europe through these self-reinforcing processes during European integration between 2000 and 2014.

### The Rise of China in the Global Production Network: What can Autocatalytic Sets teach us?.
Co-written with Flora Bellone and Paolo Zeppini  
We study the emergence of China as a dominant player in the global economy using the innovative concept of the autocatalytic set (ACS) introduced by Jain and Krishna (1998). We start by building a World Input-Output Network (WION) from the second version of the World Input-Output database (WIOD), which covers the period 2000-2014. We then identify the ACSs in the WION and explore both their scaling properties and their changes over the period. Our analysis shows the evolution of Chinese industries from peripheral positions to central positions of autocatalytic structures and highlights the intertemporal complementarity of local and global circular causality mechanisms in the rise of the Chinese economy.

### Brexit and Canadadvent: an application of graphs and hypergraphs to recent international trade agreements. (International economics
Co-written with Michela Chessa and Dominique Torre  
This article uses a network approach to study the relationship between trade agreements and trade flows. For the first time in the literature, hypergraphs are used to capture the topology of trade agreements. This topology will be compared to that of the commercial flow network. For our analysis, we focused on a snapshot of data from 2017 (before CETA was implemented and before Brexit). A modularity analysis carried out on both trade agreements and trade flows shows an imperfect correspondence between the communities of countries found within the two networks. The results justify Brexit as a means of reconciling networks of trade flows and agreements, and the CETA agreement as a confirmation of Canada's membership in the trade flow cluster including the EU.

### Modularity-based clustering approaches for economic networks.
Co-written with Xing Yafei, Dieter Mitsche, Konstantin Avratchenkov, Dominique Torre and Michela Chessa  
(Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)).
In this paper, we analyze modularity-based algorithms to obtain clusters of economic datasets. We investigate whether there are correlations between trade data flows between different countries and economic agreements between countries. We apply different methods to the two datasets and compare the results obtained by maximum weight matching. Surprisingly, wenote that there is not a very strong correlation between trade flows and agreements between countries.

### Autocatalytic Networks and the Green Economy.
Co-written with Alexandre Ruiz  
In this article, we study the dynamic dependence between "polluting" and "green" capacities. To this end, we analyze the autocatalytic structure of product interactions using data on bilateral trade flows and greenhouse gas emissions between 1995 and 2018. The novelty is to provide an assessment of how capabilities green are associated with industrial structure. Furthermore, we show how domestic green capabilities could predict subsequent economic growth in polluting industries.
